## Event Site Template

The goal of this repo is to minimize the amount of work it takes to develop an event site. That is, this repo is meant to present a template such that all that's needed to be done is styling and the addition of assets. Moreover, it will minimize the work needed to change descriptions and repetitive information such as schedules, FAQs, sponsors, tracks... to merely adjusting a JSON file, or even generating a new one and replacing the one in the repository.

If you're wondering why the site looks odd, it's cause it's a template. It may look odd, but the underlying structure should be pretty easy to modify and add on to. The goal here is functionality, not aesthetics. That's for when design presents their hi-fi.

To make another site from this site, fork this repository and build off the forked repository.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
